Inspired by https://github.com/isaksolheim/image-to-ascii

This is a small project that I put together in one evening that takes an image and generates a text file with ascii that tries to resemble the input image

Usage:

1. navigate to the directory containing the downloaded files.

2. compile the ImageToAscii.java file writing "javac ImageToAscii.java" in the terminal:

3. run the compiled file by writing "java ImageToAscii path\to\your\image.png"

I would recommend putting the image to convert in the same directory.
