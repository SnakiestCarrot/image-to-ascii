Inspired by https://github.com/isaksolheim/image-to-ascii

This is a small project that I put together in one evening that takes an image and generates a text file with ascii that tries to resemble the input image.

Usage:

1. Navigate to the directory containing the downloaded files.

2. Compile the ImageToAscii.java file writing "javac ImageToAscii.java" in your terminal.

3. Run the compiled file by writing "java ImageToAscii path\to\your\image.png" in your terminal.

I would recommend putting the image to convert in the same directory.
